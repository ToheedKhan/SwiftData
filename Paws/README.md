# SwiftData

In this app our learning objective is - 


1. How to save photos with Swift data to external storage.
2. Integrate Swiftui's native photo picker for user input.
3. How to fetch data from a database and display it using a grid layout.
4. Explore how to use navigation links to send data between multiple Swift UI views.
5. Create a unique editing view and a delete function, complete with an impressive user


external storage attribute which we added to the photos property.
This specifies the custom behavior that Swift data applies to the annotated property when managing the
owning class.
The external storage attribute stores the property's value as binary data adjacent to the model storage.
Also, it's worth mentioning that the Pet photo is optional and not mandatory.
This means users do not need to add a photo each time they create a new pet.
